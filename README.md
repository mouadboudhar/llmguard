# LLMGuard

Self-hosted security gateway for LLM applications.

LLMGuard sits between your AI application and any LLM 
provider. It applies three deterministic security guards 
to every request, gives you full visibility through a 
dashboard, and runs entirely inside your own infrastructure.

## Quick Start

docker compose up

## Language Model Setup

The Input Guard detects non-English prompts and translates them
locally before running its pattern checks. After installation,
download the translation models:

    python scripts/download_models.py

Supported languages: English, French, Spanish, Arabic, German,
Portuguese, Italian, Dutch, Russian, Chinese, Japanese, Turkish.

Models are downloaded once and cached locally — approximately
100MB per language pair. No internet connection is required
after the initial download.

## Guards

- **Input Guard** — blocks prompt injection before forwarding
- **Output Guard** — redacts PII and secrets from responses  
- **Retrieval AuthZ** — enforces clearance-based RAG filtering

## Integration

One URL change in your application:

base_url = "http://your-llmguard/v1"

## Status

v0.1.0 — foundation in progress
